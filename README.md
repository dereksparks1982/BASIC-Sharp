# BASIC# Ruby Bootstrap Compiler v0.1.79

BASIC# v0.1.79 adds Self-Hosting Milestone 2 Slice 6: Independent Compiler Driver + BSBC Artifact Round Trip.

v0.1.79 places `SmallCompilerSubsetDriver` in front of the accepted `SmallCompilerSubsetPipeline`. The bounded driver accepts BASIC# source text or a `.bsharp` source file, compiles through the independent pipeline, and produces a real persisted `.bsbc` BSharp Bytecode artifact plus readable disassembly.

The saved artifact is reloaded through `SmallCompilerSubsetBSBCLoader` and executed through `SmallCompilerSubsetBSBCVirtualMachine`. The artifact round-trip must reproduce the same BSBC bytes, event results, final world, and BSharp Save document as fresh in-memory independent execution. Repeated compilation is required to remain byte-for-byte deterministic, and a completed BSBC artifact must run after its original source file is removed.

The primary driver path is required to keep working while production `Lexer`, production `Parser`, production `SemanticResolver`, production `BytecodeEmitter`, production `BytecodeLoader`, production `BytecodeVirtualMachine`, and production `Runtime` constructors are disabled. Those production components remain separate referee paths only. Ruby remains the bootstrap compiler and referee authority; this is Self-Hosting Milestone 2 Slice 6, not full self-hosting and not Ruby retirement.

No new creator-facing syntax is introduced in v0.1.79. Existing BASIC# statement boundaries, action words such as `(open`, `(close`, `(lock`, `(take`, and written action order remain unchanged. Compiler complexity stays inside the compiler rather than being pushed onto the creator.

Profiles 1 through 7 remain unchanged. The BSBC binary layout remains unchanged. The dedicated driver fixture remains Profile 7 and exercises Kind inheritance, creator text, whole-number values, multiple selection, exact and Kind selectors, object interaction, IF/OTHERWISE, and follow-up events.

Current release truth: Elderedd identity migration remains active under Elderedd Softworks LLC and Elderedd Laboratory. The DKLab compatibility layer remains for compatibility, rollback, migration, and historical path support only. BCS means BSharp Creator Services and remains a future service layer, not part of this build. The README Current Release Truth Gate remains active.

Release hardening remains active: Elderedd path direction, UTF-8 source reading, minimal/no-locale Ruby validation, release package preflight, deterministic fixture hash sweep, payload SHA-256 checks, changed-file scope checks, release forensic overlay, pre-mutation forensic overlay, and the sealed validation inventory must report all mismatches together.

The whole-language test gauntlet remains at 128,000 event paths, 128,000 platform frames, 384 generated programs, and 3,072 mutations. v0.1.79 changes bounded compiler-driver and artifact handling only and preserves creator-facing language meaning, Save, ASK, input behaviour, and normal production compiler/runtime routing.

## What Milestone 1 means

```text
Allowed claim:
BSharp Compiler Subset 0 has a sealed reader, parser, IR emitter, BSBC emitter,
fixture corpus, parity harnesses, runtime smoke lane, bootstrap boundary audit,
and milestone gate under Ruby referee control.

Forbidden claim:
BASIC# is fully self-hosted or Ruby has been retired.
```

## What the Milestone 2 proposal means

```text
Allowed claim:
v0.1.72 proposes the next self-hosting expansion direction and identifies the
records that must be repaired before implementation.

Forbidden claim:
v0.1.72 does not implement Self-Hosting Milestone 2, does not make BASIC#
self-hosted, and does not retire Ruby.
```

## v0.1.72 release hardening note

v0.1.72 records Derek's release closeout rule: the installer and full native validation must prove the build before acceptance; the accepted snapshot comes before local Git commit/tag; GitHub closeout comes after local acceptance; and future assistants must follow the proven project transcript instead of guessing at SSH keys, HTTPS password prompts, or giant token blocks.
