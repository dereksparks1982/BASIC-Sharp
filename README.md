# BASIC# Ruby Bootstrap Compiler v0.1.74

BASIC# v0.1.74 adds Self-Hosting Milestone 2 Slice 1: Semantic Resolver Independence.

v0.1.74 gives BSharp Compiler Subset 0 its own SmallCompilerSubsetSemanticResolver for the primary subset IR path while the production Ruby SemanticResolver remains a separate referee. Exact BSharp IR, BSBC, and BSharp VM parity remain required, including the v0.1.73 open, close, lock, and take object-interaction actions.

This is Self-Hosting Milestone 2 Slice 1, not full self-hosting. Self-Hosting Milestone 1 remains preserved as the accepted foundation. Ruby remains the bootstrap compiler, the production Ruby SemanticResolver remains the referee, and the Ruby referee runtime remains available for parity verification. Normal BASIC# production compilation is unchanged.

The independent subset path is now `TokenizerReader -> SmallCompilerSubsetParser -> SmallCompilerSubsetSemanticResolver -> BSharp IR -> subset BSBC -> BSharp Virtual Machine`. The execution corpus grows to 18 fixtures and 56 event executions, including explicit object interaction proof for open, close, lock, and take. BSBC execution parity remains mandatory.

Current release truth: Elderedd identity migration remains active under Elderedd Softworks LLC and Elderedd Laboratory. The DKLab compatibility layer remains for compatibility, rollback, migration, and historical path support only. BCS means BSharp Creator Services and remains a future service layer, not part of this build. The README Current Release Truth Gate remains active.

Release hardening remains unchanged: Elderedd path direction, UTF-8 source reading, minimal/no-locale Ruby validation, release package preflight, deterministic fixture hash sweep, payload SHA-256 checks, changed-file scope checks, release forensic overlay, pre-mutation forensic overlay, and the sealed validation inventory must report all mismatches together. The Open3 capture encoding gap remains repaired so CLI validation remains truthful.

The whole-language test gauntlet remains at 128,000 event paths, 128,000 platform frames, 384 generated programs, and 3,072 mutations. v0.1.74 changes compiler-subset semantic ownership only and preserves the existing runtime behaviour and creator-facing language.

## What Milestone 1 means

```text
Allowed claim:
BSharp Compiler Subset 0 has a sealed reader, parser, IR emitter, BSBC emitter,
fixture corpus, parity harnesses, runtime smoke lane, bootstrap boundary audit,
and milestone gate under Ruby referee control.

Forbidden claim:
BASIC# is fully self-hosted or Ruby has been retired.
```

## What the Milestone 2 proposal means

```text
Allowed claim:
v0.1.72 proposes the next self-hosting expansion direction and identifies the
records that must be repaired before implementation.

Forbidden claim:
v0.1.72 does not implement Self-Hosting Milestone 2, does not make BASIC#
self-hosted, and does not retire Ruby.
```

## v0.1.72 release hardening note

v0.1.72 records Derek's release closeout rule: the installer and full native validation must prove the build before acceptance; the accepted snapshot comes before local Git commit/tag; GitHub closeout comes after local acceptance; and future assistants must follow the proven project transcript instead of guessing at SSH keys, HTTPS password prompts, or giant token blocks.
